Well, guys, you  made it to the promised neverland... um... the private repo!!!,
Since this is our first day collabrating, lets just try to finish this basic exercise

copy the link of this repo
and clone this repo using vscode's source control section (view the video)
in intro folder, add yourname.txt with some stuff
later stage change, commit change (video ) and push the change (i sent a screenshot on group)

if you did it right, we'll be seeing your file in our repo



in later stages, we'll use different branches and only merge on main when the project is stable
